        <li>1/2 cup (110g) caster sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (180ml) mirin</li>

</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        For the black pepper base, heat the grapeseed oil in a medium saucepan 
        over medium-low heat. Add the eschalot, ginger and garlic, and cook, 
        stirring frequently, for 8-10 minutes until softened. Add remaining 
        ingredients and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 20-25 minutes 
        until reduced by half. Set aside 2 tbs of black pepper base for this 
        recipe. Cool remaining mixture, transfer to an airtight container and 
        refrigerate or freeze for another use.

    <li>
        To make the black pepper broth, combine kombu tsuyu, 2 tbs reserved 
        black pepper base (or to taste) and 400ml water in a medium saucepan. 
        Stand for 12-15 minutes, then place over medium- high heat and bring 
        to the boil. Turn off heat and stand for 30 minutes to infuse.

        Meanwhile, half-fill a medium saucepan with vegetable oil. Place over 
        high heat and heat to 170°C (a cube of bread will turn golden in 60 
        seconds when the oil is hot enough). Place kuzu and tofu in a bowl and 
        toss gently to coat. In batches, fry tofu for 4-5 minutes until lightly 
        golden and crisp. Remove using a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel. 
        Season to taste.

        Divide tofu among bowls and pour over broth. Scatter with shaved bonito 
        and sliced long green shallot to serve.
