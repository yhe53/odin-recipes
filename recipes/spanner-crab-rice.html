<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>For the crispy rice, drain soaked rice and cook to packet instructions. 
        Heat 1 tbs sesame oil in a large non-stick, heavy- based, high-sided 
        frypan over medium- high heat. Add rice and spread into an even layer. 
        Cook without stirring for 6-8 minutes until rice is crispy and golden 
        on the bottom. Combine XO sauce, lemon juice and soy sauce in a bowl 
        and drizzle over the rice. Mix to combine, using a large metal spoon 
        to fold crispy rice into the soft rice.</li>
    <li>Scatter over crab, edamame, takuan, nori, sliced long green shallot 
        and drizzle with extra sesame oil. Place a spoonful of tobiko orange 
        in the centre. Serve in pan.</li>
